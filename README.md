# Advanced_timeConverter
A tweaked version of a normal time converter


Created by Dennis


The time converter takes in seconds and converts it into hours and minutes in a linear fashion, the interesting thing about this, is that it is built with a logic that has the ability to detect and display correctly when a plural data is printed.
